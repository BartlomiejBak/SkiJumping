#### new description
One of the first apps in repo. Actually I am refactoring the code to improve readability and implement clean code rules.

Program will generate a list of competitors and competitions. The goal is to simulate ski jumping tournament.
Any jumper will have a set of skills, which will be included in jumps they made.
Any jump will be graded by jury team according to FIS rules.
